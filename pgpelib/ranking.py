def compute_centered_ranks(x: Iterable) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Convert the given fitness array to an array of linear ranks.

    The ranks are centered around 0, the element with the lowest fitness
    is assigned the rank -0.5, and the element with the highest fitness is
    assigned the rank +0.5. This is the ranking method used in
    OpenAI's evolution strategy variant (Salimans et al. (2017)).

    Args:
        x: A sequence of fitness values

    Returns:
